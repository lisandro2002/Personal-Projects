# Lisandro Torres' - Projects

As a motivated and detail-oriented Computer Science Student, I am actively seeking an internship opportunity where I can apply the skills and knowledge I have gained through my studies to real-world projects. I believe that interning at a company or organization will provide me with valuable hands-on experience and allow me to learn and grow as a software engineer. I am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to a team and make a positive impact through my work. In my studies, I have completed numerous projects utilizing machine learning algorithms such as SVM, decision trees, KNN-Classifier, Natural Processing Language, and MLP models. I have also gained experience in object-oriented design and agile development methodologies. In addition, I possess strong problem-solving and communication skills, and am proficient in Spanish.

## Skills
