# Lisandro Torres' - Projects

As a motivated and detail-oriented Computer Science Student, I am seeking an internship opportunity to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world projects, while also learning and growing as a software engineer. I have experience in C++, Python, and Java, as well as experience creating projects using machine learning algorithms such as SVM, decision trees, KNN-Classifier, Natural Processing Language, and MLP models. I have also developed applications using object-oriented designs. I am skilled in problem-solving, have strong communication skills, and am familiar with agile development methodologies. I am also bilingual and can speak Spanish proficiently. I am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to a team and make a positive impact through my work.
