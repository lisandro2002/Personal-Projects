# Lisandro Torres' - Projects

As a motivated and detail-oriented Computer Science Student(Junior), I am actively seeking an internship opportunity where I can apply the skills and knowledge I have gained through my studies to real-world projects. I believe that interning at a company or organization will provide me with valuable hands-on experience and allow me to learn and grow as a software engineer. I am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to a team and make a positive impact through my work. In my studies, I have completed numerous projects utilizing machine learning algorithms such as SVM, decision trees, KNN-Classifier, Natural Processing Language, and MLP models. I have also gained experience in object-oriented design and agile development methodologies. In addition, I possess strong problem-solving and communication skills, and am proficient in Spanish.

## Skills

I have experience in C++, Python, and Java, as well as experience creating projects using machine learning algorithms such as SVM, decision trees, KNN-Classifier, Natural Processing Language, and MLP models. I have also developed applications using object-oriented designs.

## Projects

### Penguins Species Prediction
- Predicting the distinct species of penguins based on features such as height, length, and width. I utilized SVM models, decision trees,  Cross-Validation, Confusion Matrices, and Confidence Intervals.
- The prediction program includes heat maps, histograms, pair plots, scatter plots, and visualization tools that are utilized to view the data distribution and trends of the penguins' data using modules such as seaborn and sklearn.metrics
### Credit Card Default Prediction
- Using machine learning models to predict the likelihood someone with a credit card will default based on their balanced and age in python
The prediction program includes heat maps, histograms, pair plots, scatter plots, and visualization tools that are utilized to view the data distribution and trends of the credit card usersâ€™ data
### Sudoku Solution Solver
- This is a C++ program that uses the backtracking algorithm to solve a Sudoku puzzle. 
If no solution is found, the program will catch the error and print a message.

### Fake News Predictions
- The focus of this model was to predict if a piece of news was fake based on the title and keywords found in the article considered as misleading or inaccurate information by employing Natural Language Processing algorithms.
